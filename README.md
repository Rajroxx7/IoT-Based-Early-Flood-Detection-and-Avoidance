# IoT-Based-Early-Flood-Detection-and-Avoidance
Flood is an inevitable and damaging natural disaster. On the other hand, it creates a huge economic damage and cause a significant loss in human life. Using different sensors,namely DHT11, Water level sensor and Water Flow Sensor, with the of Arduino UNO to measure the parameters then, a NodeMCU is placed in the flood prone areas where the NodeMCU acts as the transmitting unit which consists of above sensors that is used transmitting data to Thingspeak IoT platform and then the data is displayed through the LCD. Proposed model is also useful for us in anticipating the for the coming calamities and to take essential activities by emergency and recover experts to spare the life of thousands of individuals before this basic condition happens. The Flood Detector System using Arduino is created to be one of the quickest strategies to monitor flood and Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the most important technical trends which is utilized to monitor flood and human made resources to help in predicting and detecting essential events like flood, fire, gas and water leak that can position an threats to human life.
